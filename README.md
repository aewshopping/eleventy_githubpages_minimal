# Minimal eleventy with github pages

Objective is to make a minimal eleventy site and serve with github pages.

I am going to copy the output directory _site to the repo, rather than do what you should normally do which is .gitignore it.

This is to make github pages setup super easy, at the cost of duplicating code.
